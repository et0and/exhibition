# A virtual show

Locked Down, presented by Te Wāhi Auaha and powered by Kunstmatrix 3D, showcased the artwork of several year 10 TGS students made during Level 4 lockdown of Term 3, 2021. 

## About the show

Unable to return to school and with limited resources, ākonga at TGS began turning to digital and virtual methods of art-making. At the frontier of a Covid-19 landscape, this was an opportunity for their artwork to be shown in a new, emerging format. The first ever Te Wāhi Auaha online art exhibition.
